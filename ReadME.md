# React Ecosystems

## Description
This applicaton was created to demonstrate a basic understanding of React Ecosystems such as Redux, Redux Thunk, and Reselect. This is a responsive, full-stack React Web Application that uses styled components to allow the user to create, update, and delete their to-do list items. This application was built from scratch (without using "create-react-app") to demonstrate an understanding of webpack, babel, and the intricacies of the React Architecture.
